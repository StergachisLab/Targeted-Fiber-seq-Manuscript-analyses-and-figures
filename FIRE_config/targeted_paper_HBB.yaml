## Force a read coverage instead of calulating it genome wide from the bam file.
## This can be useful if only a subset of the genome has reads.

## regions to not use when identifying null regions that should not have RE, below are the defaults auto used for hg38.

#- workflow/annotations/hg38.blacklist.ENCFF356LFX.bed.gz
#- workflow/annotations/hg38.gap.bed.gz
#- workflow/annotations/SDs.merged.hg38.bed.gz

## you can optionally specify a model that is not the default.
# model: models/my-custom-model.dat

## only used if training a new model

# train: True
# dhs: workflow/annotations/GM12878_DHS.bed.gz # regions of suspected regulatory elements

# Filter peaks on a % accesible threshold instead of FDR. Removes FDR filtering.
min_per_acc_peak: 0.15 # enforce 15% of reads in peak are accessible
